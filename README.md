Have you ever wanted to see artwork from different cultures? Look no further!

## This app utilizes:
- Svelte / Javascript
- The Harvard Art Museum API
- Svelte Testing Library / Jest

## Setup

Feel free to pull down this repo, run 'npm install'.

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm run dev` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:3000/`. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

If you want, feel free to run `npm test` to check out our coverage and make sure everything is passing!

### Wins

This project was a learning experience to gain more confidence in Svelte. I would say some of the best things that were accomplished include: 
1. Implementing testing using the Svelte Testing Library. 
2. Learning how Svelte works with Javascript in a broad way.

### Challenges

1. Implementing full testing coverage (and seeing what the coverage actually is, since it's difficult to access .svelte files).
2. Styling with Svelte components.
